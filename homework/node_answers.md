1. Node is a platform for building server-side event driver i/o applications whereas Express is a framework for building web-applications using principles and approaches of Node.

2. Express is a framework for Node.  It makes it faster and easier to work with node for a web application.

3. Fast, unopinionated, minimalist:
	* Fast: non-blocking, asyncronous just like node. It also has certain module's built in (like http), so you don't have to repeat yourself so often.
	* Unopinionated: there is no "right way" to work in express, unlike ruby, et al
	* Minimalist: I can't really find an answer to how it is minimalist. My guess is that it doesn't use much memory and tries to consolidate methods and modules into things that are less bulky and easier to work with. But, I don't really know :(.
